"I recently visited Oliver Brown on a weekend for a cup of iced coffee, and I was thoroughly impressed. The ambience was inviting, the seating comfortable, and the service top-notch. I had the pleasure of trying their iced coffee and dark hot chocolate, both of which were absolutely delicious. It's an excellent place overall, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit",positive

The owner didn't let us sit in the AC though it was not at all reserved. We already had booked our table priorly then also he didn't give us the AC table to sit. He said that you should call us and book the AC table but no one ever picks the call at all. ,negative

Zomato shows 15% off on dining bill and the owner says we can offer 15% discount only if the bill is a minimum of Rs. 1000. Zomato doesn't mention any such thing but these guys have their own rules.What a joke! Customer banne se pehle hi customer tut gaya. ,negative

New concept of the cafe is quiet appealing that’s game+foodLike the food here Have visited this cafe several times Previously it used to b so much chaotic which was a minus point but now I think that is managed Every item v ordered here so far is yummy so far no complaints They have recently made changes in menu which I think is trouble becoz very short menu by far but I would appreciate that they manage to make a whole wheat paratha in place of all purpose flour in their combos Secondly their Mexican Buddha bowl is so yum,positive

"The staff is rude, they behave as if they are obliging on us & providing service & food for free. We ordered alfredo pasta, jain margarita pizza & fried wonton. Pasta & wonton were good but pizza was way to sweet. Upon confronting the staff their response was slow & made faces. They responded that we use ready-made sauces so it would taste sweet only in a rude way & didn't mention it at the time of placing the order. We do understand that servers are not responsible for taste of food but they should respond properly.",negative

"Nestled within the CEE campus in the Thaltej area of Ahmedabad, Café Aarambh offers a tranquil and serene ambience, providing a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. While this café remains relatively unknown to many city dwellers, its peaceful atmosphere makes it a hidden gem worth discovering.However, when it comes to the culinary aspect, Café Aarambh falls short of expectations. The food offerings, unfortunately, do not match the serene ambience. The taste of the dishes is rather average, leaving much to be desired, especially considering the price one pays. The limited food options available might disappoint those looking for a diverse range of choices.One...read more",neutral

"it's a good place and I can vouch for their cheesecakes but they cheat you, first of all their dine in price for cheesecake is 200 and in Zomato they show 300. I have Zomato gold and they would refuse me to pay through it by saying the Zomato 20% discount is only on menu but when you see their dining page, the first photo they have is of a cheesecake! hypocrisy? I love their cheesecakes but i don't like cheaters so I'd not go there again!",negative
